In this datacamp project, we will analyze seven years worth of training data (2012 - 2018) from [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) of an individual. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. In this project, we will create import, clean, and analyze the  data to answer the questions below and many more:

- How fast, long, and intense was the run on a daily, monthly and yearly basis?
- Has the person succeeded with training goal of running 1000 km per year?
- Is the individual progressing over the years in terms of running distance?
- What were the person's best achievements? 
- How is the distribution of heart rate data by training intensity (grouped into 5 categories)?
- How does the summary statistics look like for each training activity?
